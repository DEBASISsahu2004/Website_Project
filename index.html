            <p>A <span class="tooltip" >flood<span class="tooltiptext">Overflow of a body of water onto land.</span></span> happens when water overflows or soaks land that is normally dry.
                 Generally, floods take hours or even days to develop, giving residents time to prepare or <span class="tooltip" >evacuate<span class="tooltiptext">To leave or remove from a dangerous place.</span></span>. 
                 Sometimes, floods develop quickly and with little warning.</p>

            <p>Human changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding,
                 for example land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, 
                 changes in waterway course or flood controls such as with 
                 <span class="tooltip" >levees<span class="tooltiptext">Bank of a river, raised either naturally or constructed by people.</span></span>, 
                 and larger environmental issues such as climate change and sea level rise. 
                 In particular climate change's increased rainfall and extreme weather events increases the severity of other causes for flooding, 
                 resulting in more intense floods and increased flood risk.</p>

            <p>A flood can develop in a many ways. The most common is when <span class="tooltip" >rivers<span class="tooltiptext">large stream of flowing freshwater.</span></span> 
                or <span class="tooltip" >streams<span class="tooltiptext">Body of flowing fluid.</span></span> overflow their 
                <span class="tooltip" >banks<span class="tooltiptext">A slope of land adjoining a body of water, or a large elevated area of the sea floor.</span></span>. 
                These floods are called <span class="tooltip" >riverine floods<span class="tooltiptext">Process where a river or stream overflows its banks.</span></span>. 
                Heavy rain, a broken dam or <span class="tooltip" >levee<span class="tooltiptext">Bank of a river, raised either naturally or constructed by people.</span></span>, 
                rapid icemelt in the mountains, or even a beaver dam in a vulnerable spot can overwhelm a river and send it spreading over nearby land. 
                The land surrounding a river is called a <span class="tooltip" >flood plain<span class="tooltiptext">Flat area alongside a stream or river that is subject to flooding.</span></span>. 
                <span class="tooltip" >Coastal flooding<span class="tooltiptext">Process where a storm or tsunami causes the sea to rush inland, as a storm surge.</span></span>, 
                also called <b>estuarine flooding</b>, happens when a large storm or tsunami causes the sea to rush 
                <span class="tooltip" >inland<span class="tooltiptext">Area not near the ocean.</span></span>.</p>

            <p >Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. 
                While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water, 
                people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and 
                because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry. 
                Flooding can lead to secondary consequences in addition to damage to property, such as long-term displacement of residents 
                and creating increased spread of waterborne diseases and <span class="tooltip" >vector-borne diseases<span class="tooltiptext">Disease that results from an infection.</span></span> 
                to humans and other animals by blood-feeding anthropods, such as mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas.</p>

            <p>According to our friends at the "National Severe Storms Laboratory", there are five types of floods. They include:</p>
            <a class="img1" href="#river"><img src="/Images/1.png" alt="1"><span>River Flood</span></a>
            <a class="img1" href="#coastal"><img src="/Images/2.png" alt="2"><span>Coastal Flood</span></a>

            <p>Flooding can occur anywhere, including both coastal and inland areas, as you can see from the list above. 
                Let's examine each type of flood in greater detail.</p>

            <h1 class="topic">What is a River Flood ?</h1>
            <div class="img2"><img src="/Images/river flood.jpg" alt="River flood"></div>
            <p>A river flood occurs when water levels rise over the top of river banks. 
                This flooding can happen in all river and stream channels. This includes everything from small streams to the world's largest rivers.</p>
            <p>River floods have also been life-giving forces for human societies dependent on them for agriculture and soil fertility. 
                Nonetheless, humans often perceive floods negatively because of the damage and loss of life they often wreak where natural floodways have 
                become heavily developed and populated.</p>
            <p>River floods can happen suddenly or slowly. Sudden river flooding events occur more often on smaller rivers, rivers with steep valleys, 
                rivers that flow for much of their length over impermeable terrain, and normally dry channels.On the other hand, low-rising river floods 
                typically occur in large rivers with large <span class="tooltip" >catchment area<span class="tooltiptext">Any area of land where precipitation collects and runs off into a common outlet.</span></span>.</p>
            
            <h2 class="sub_topic">Causes of River Flooding</h2>
            <p>River flooding typically happens for four reasons. They are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excessive rain from tropical storm systems making landfall.</li>
                <li>Persistent thunderstorms over the same area for extended periods</li>
                <li>Combined rainfall and snowmelt</li>
                <li><span class="tooltip" >Ice jams<span class="tooltiptext">Chunks of ice clump together to block the flow of a river.</span></span></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="coastal" style="color:rgba(250, 235, 215, 0.684) ;">.</h2>
            <h1 class="topic">What is a Coastal Flood ?</h1>
            <div class="img2"><img src="/Images/coastal flood.png" alt="Coastal flood"></div>
            <p>Coastal flooding is a sudden and abrupt inundation of a coastal environment caused by a short-term increase in water level due to a storm surge and extreme tides. 
                The magnitude and extension depend on the coastal topography, storm surge conditions and broader bathymetry of the coastal area.</p>
            <p>Coastal flooding is generally a natural process and constitutes an important part of the natural coastal dynamics, especially for salt marshes and mangrove forests. 
                In areas with human activities, however, it can constitute a major challenge and lead to loss of property and lives. Over the last 200 years, 
                it is estimated that about two million people have been killed in flood events mainly in South Asia and with growing coastal populations and sea level rise, 
                the world faces increasing potential for coastal flood disasters.</p>
            <h2 class="sub_topic">Causes of Coastal Flooding</h2>
            <p>Coastal flooding is typically a result of a combination of sea tidal surges, high winds, and barometric pressure.</p>
            <p>These conditions typically come from storms at sea like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tropical cyclones</li>
                <li>Tsunami</li>
                <li>Combined rainfall and snowmelt</li>
                <li>Higher-than-average tides</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="strom" style="color:rgba(250, 235, 215, 0.684) ;">.</h2>
            <h1 class="topic">What is a Storm Surge ?</h1>
            <div class="img2"><img src="/Images/storm surge.jpg" alt="Storm Surge"></div>
            <p>A storm surge, storm flood, tidal surge, or storm tide is a coastal flood or tsunami-like phenomenon of rising water commonly 
                associated with low-pressure weather systems, such as cyclones. It is measured as the rise in water level above the normal tidal level, 
                and does not include waves.</p>
            <p>The storms produce strong winds that push the water into shore, which can lead to flooding. 
                This makes storm surges very dangerous for coastal regions.</p>
            <p>A storm surge is primarily caused by the relationship between the winds and the ocean's surface. 
                The water level rises where the winds are strongest. In addition, water is pushed in the direction the winds are blowing. 
                The rotation of the Earth causes winds to move toward the right in the Northern Hemisphere and toward the left in the Southern Hemisphere—a 
                phenomenon known as the <span class="tooltip" >Corilis effect<span class="tooltiptext">The result of Earth's rotation on weather patterns and ocean currents.</span></span>.</p>
            <p>Extreme flooding occurs when storm surge happens at the same time as high tide. This can cause storm tides to reach over 2o feet!. 
                Our meteorologists always stress that storm surge is the most dangerous aspect of any tropical system. 
                It poses the most threat to both life and property. In the past, we've seen truly devastating storm surge impacts.</p>
            <h2 class="sub_topic">Causes of Storm Surge</h2>
            <p>Storm surge is always a result meteorological storms that cause higher than normal tides on the coast. 
                There are three parts of a storm that create this surge. They are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wind</li>
                <li>Waves</li>
                <li>Low atmospheric pressure</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="inland" style="color:rgba(250, 235, 215, 0.684) ;">.</h2>
            <h1 class="topic">What is a Inland Flood ?</h1>
            <div class="img2"><img src="/Images/inland flood.jpeg" alt="inland flood"></div>
            <p>Inland flooding, also known as “urban flooding” or
                “flash flooding”, can be caused by intense, short-term
                rain or by moderate rainfall over several days that can
                overwhelm existing drainage infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Unlike coastal floods, which are caused by a practically
                unlimited source of ocean water, inland floods can be
                reduced by storing or redirecting water through sewer
                infrastructure, changing topography, and increasing
                permeable surfaces. Also, unlike coastal flooding,
                inland flooding can be difficult to predict and occur with
                little notice. </p>
            <h2 class="sub_topic">Causes of Inland Flooding</h2>
            <p>Rainfall is almost always to blame for inland floods. Rain causes inland flooding in two ways. 
                It can happen with steady rainfall over several days or it can happen because of a short and intense period of rainfall.</p>
            <p>Snowmelt also causes inland floods, although rainfall is a more common cause.</p>
            <p>Another way inland flooding happens is when water ways get blocked by 
                <span class="tooltip" >debris<span class="tooltiptext">Loose natural material consisting especially of broken pieces of rock.</span></span>, ice, or dams.</p>
            <p>Inland floods are often worse in urban areas because there isn't anywhere for the water to go. 
                The following urban features can create urban flooding or make inland floods worse:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paved roads and streets</li>
                <li>Low-capacity drainage equipment</li>
                <li>Dense buildings</li>
                <li>Low amounts of green space</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="topic">What is a Flash Flood ?</h1>
            <div class="img2"><img src="/Images/flash flood.webp" alt="flash flood"></div>
            <p>A flash flood is flooding that begins within 6 hours, and often within 3 hours, of heavy rainfall (or other cause).</p>
            <p>Urban Areas are also prone to flooding in short time-spans and, sometimes, rainfall (from the same storm) over an urban 
                area will cause flooding faster and more-severe than in the suburbs or countryside. The impervious surfaces in the urban areas 
                do not allow water to infiltrate the ground, and the water runs off to the low spots very quickly.</p>
            <p>Flash Flooding occurs so quickly that people are caught off-guard. Their situation may become dangerous if they encounter high, 
                fast-moving water while traveling. If people are at their homes or businesses, the water may rise quickly and trap them, 
                or cause damage to the property without them having a chance to protect the property.</p>
            <h2 class="sub_topic">Causes of Flash Flooding</h2>
            <p>Flash floods can happen for several reasons.</p>
            <p>Most flash floods happen after extremely intense rainfall from severe thunderstorms over a short period of time (normally 6 hours or less). 
                There are two key elements to determine is flash flooding is likely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rainfall rate</li>
                <li>Rainfall duration</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Flash floods also happen when damns break, when levees fail, or when an ice jam releases a large amount of water.</p>

            <p>No matter what type of flood you're dealing with, 
                they are generally caused by the same key factors and there are always negative effects.</p>
            <p>As we mentioned above, there are plenty of different causes of flooding. 
                While different flood types typically have different causes, 
                most floods are caused by one of the following activities listed below:</p>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/1.png" alt="1"><p><b>Heavy rainfall</b> is the simplest cause of flooding. 
                When there is too much rain or it happens too fast, there just isn't a place for it to go. 
                This can result in floods like flash flooding.</p></span></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/2.png" alt="2"><p><b>Overflowing rivers</b> are another cause of floods. 
                You don't necessarily need heavy rains though to experience river flooding. As we mentioned before, 
                river flooding can happen when there is debris in the river or dams that block the flow of the water.</p></span></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/3.png" alt="3"><p>Speaking of dams, <b>broken dams</b> are another cause of flooding. 
                Older infrastructure can fail when heavy rains come and water levels rise. When dams break, 
                they unleash torrents of water on unsuspecting households.</p></span></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/4.png" alt="4"><p><b>Storm surge and tsunamis</b> also cause flooding. 
                Storm surges from hurricanes and other tropical systems can cause sea levels to rise and cover normally 
                dry coastal areas in several feet of water. Tsunamis on the other hand are giant waves caused by earthquakes or 
                underwater volcanic eruptions. As these waves move inland, they build height and can push a lot of water inland in coastal areas.</p></span></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/5.png" alt="5"><p><b>Channels with steep banks</b> are also to blame for flooding. 
                Flooding often occurs when there is fast runoff into lakes, rivers, and other basins. 
                This is often the case with rivers and other channels that feature steep sides.</p></span></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/6.png" alt="6"><p><b>A lack of vegetation</b> can cause flooding. 
                Vegetation can help slow runoff and prevent flooding. When there is a lack of vegetation, 
                there is little to stop water from running off and overflowing river banks and streams.</p></span></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/7.png" alt="7"><p><b>Melting snow and ice</b> is another common reason for flooding. 
                When a large amount of snow and/or ice melts quickly, it often doesn't have somewhere to go except low-lying areas.</p></span></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/8.png" alt="8"><p><b>Emission of Greenhouse Gases</b>, The burning of fossil fuels, 
                the industrial influences, the pollution all is depleting the level of the ozone layer and increasing the level of 
                greenhouse gases, becoming a major cause of man-made flooding.</p></span></div>
            <p>Although not the only causes of flooding, these are some of the most frequent ones.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is hardly surprising that rivers have been an important part of human history: 
                They provide food, freshwater, and fertile land for growing crops. While water is essential to life, 
                it can be a destructive force too. When rivers flood, the effects can be catastrophic.

            <p>Flood control <b>(or flood management or flood protection)</b> methods are used to reduce or prevent the detrimental effects of 
                flood waters. Flood relief methods are used to reduce the effects of flood waters or high water levels. Flooding can be caused 
                by a mix of both natural processes, such as <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather" target="_blank">extreme weather</a> upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff. 
                Though building <a class="word_link"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_infrastructure" target="_blank">hard infrastructure</a> to prevent flooding, such as <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_wall" target="_blank">flood walls</a>,

                handle changes water flow, but also natural processes like tides.</p>
            <h1 class="topic">Methods of flood management:</h1>
            <p>Some methods of flood control have been practiced since ancient times. 
                These methods include planting vegetation to retain extra water, <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrace_(earthworks)" target="_blank">terracing</a> hillsides to slow flow downhill, 
                and the construction of floodways (man-made channels to divert floodwater). Other techniques include the construction 
                of levees, lakes, dams, reservoirs, <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retention_basin" target="_blank">retension ponds</a> to hold extra water during times of flooding.</p>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/1.png" alt="1"><p><b style="font-size:28px;">Coastal management: </b>
                <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_management" target="_blank">Coastal management</a> is defence against flooding and <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion" target="_blank">erosion</a>, and techniques that stop erosion to claim lands. 
                Protection against rising sea levels in the 21st century is crucial, as sea level rise accelerates due to <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change" target="_blank">climate change</a>. 
                Changes in sea level damage beaches and coastal systems are expected to rise at an increasing rate, 
                causing coastal sediments to be disturbed by tidal energy.</p></span><p class="second">Coastal zones occupy less than 15% of the Earth's land area, 
                    while they host more than 40% of the world population. Nearly 1.2 billion people live within 100 km of shoreline 
                    and 100 m of sea level, with an average density 3 times higher than the global average for population. 
                    With three-quarters of the world population expected to reside in the coastal zone by 2025, 
                    human activities originating from this small land area will impose heavy pressure on coasts. 
                    Coastal zones contain rich resources to produce goods and services and are home to most commercial and 
                    industrial activities.</p></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/2.png" alt="2"><p><b style="font-size:28px;">Dams: </b>
                Many dams and their associated reservoirs are designed completely or partially to aid in flood protection and control. 
                Many large dams have flood-control reservations in which the level of a reservoir must be kept below a certain elevation 
                before the onset of the rainy/summer melt season to allow a certain amount of space in which floodwaters can fill. Other 
                beneficial uses of dam created reservoirs include hydroelectric power generation, water conservation, and recreation. 
                Reservoir and dam construction and design is based upon standards, typically set out by the government. 
                In the United States, dam and reservoir design is regulated by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). 
                Design of a dam and reservoir follows guidelines set by the USACE and covers topics such as design flow rates 
                in consideration to meteorological, topographic, streamflow, and soil data for the watershed above the structure.</p></span>
                <p class="second">The term dry dam refers to a dam that serves purely for flood control without any conservation 
                    storage (e.g. Mount Morris Dam, Seven Oaks Dam).</p></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/3.png" alt="3"><p><b style="font-size:28px;">Diversion canals: </b>
                Flood control channels are large and empty basins which let water flow in and out (except during flooding) 
                or dry channels that run below the street levels of some larger cities, so that if and when a flood occurs, 
                the water will run into these channels, and eventually drain into a river or other body of water. 
                Flood channels are sometimes built on the former courses of waterways as a way to reduce flooding.</p></span></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/4.png" alt="4"><p><b style="font-size:28px;">Floodplains and groundwater replenishment: </b>
                Excess water can be used for <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater_recharge" target="_blank">groundwater replenishment</a> by diversion onto land that can absorb the water. 
                This technique can reduce the impact of later droughts by using the ground as a natural reservoir. 
                It is being used in California, where orchards and vineyards can be flooded without damaging crops, 
                or in other places wilderness areas have been re-engineered to act as floodplains.</p></span></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/5.png" alt="5"><p><b style="font-size:28px;">River defenses: </b>
                In many countries, rivers are prone to floods and are often carefully managed. Defenses such as levees, 
                <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunding" target="_blank">bunds</a>, reservoirs, and <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir" target="_blank">weirs</a> are used to prevent rivers from bursting their banks. 
                A weir, also known as a lowhead dam, is most often used to create <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermill" target="_blank">millponds</a>, but on the Humber River in Toronto, 
                a weir was built near Raymore Drive to prevent a recurrence of the flood damage caused by Hurricane Hazel 
                in October 1954.</p></span><p class="second">The Leeds flood alleviation scheme uses movable weirs which 
                    are lowered during periods of high water to reduce the chances of flooding upstream. 
                    They are designed to reduce potential flood levels by up to one metre.</p></div>
            <div><span class="img3"><img src="/Images/6.png" alt="6"><p><b style="font-size:28px;">Coastal defenses: </b>

                <p class="second"><a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_barrage" target="_blank">Tide gates</a> 
                    are used in conjunction with dykes and culverts. They can be placed at the mouth of streams or small rivers, 
                    where an <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary" target="_blank">estuary</a> begins or where tributary streams, or drainage ditches 
                    connect to <a class="word_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slough_(hydrology)" target="_blank">sloughs</a>. Tide gates close during incoming tides to prevent 
                    tidal waters from moving upland, and open during outgoing tides to allow waters to drain out via the culvert and into the estuary side of the dike. 
                    The opening and closing of the gates is driven by a difference in water level on either side of the gate.</p></div>

            <p>The first thing you should do before a flood is assemble <b>an emergency kit</b>. 
                Your flood emergency kit should include food, water, and medicine. 
                You should pack a supply of these items that will last each person three days. 
                You should also put the following in your kit:</p>
            <div class="img4"><img src="/Images/CheckMark.png" alt="check_mark"><p>Phone Charger</p></div>
            <div class="img4"><img src="/Images/CheckMark.png" alt="check_mark"><p>Batteries</p></div>

            <div class="img4"><img src="/Images/CheckMark.png" alt="check_mark"><p>NOAA Weather Radio</p></div>
            <p>You should also have a cell phone on hand. This way, you can <b>communicate</b> with your friends, family, and coworkers.</p>
            <p>The next thing you can do to prepare for a flood is research your home or organization's location to 
                <b>assess flood risk</b>. Are you located in a flood plain? What's the fastest way to get to higher ground? 
                Knowing the answers to these questions can help you in the case of floods.</p>
            <p>One last flood tip we recommend is to <b>sign up for flooding notifications</b>. 
                The National Weather Service issues Flood Advisories, Flood Watches, and Flood Warnings to 
                help people prepare for flooding dangers.</p>
            <div class="img3"><img src="/Images/1.png" alt="1"><p>A <b>Flood Advisory</b> means you should be mindful 
                of possible flooding because a weather event is forecast to occur that could result in flooding. 
                The National Weather Service issues these advisories when flooding isn't expected to be bad enough 
                to issue a warning, but could still pose minor threats.</p></div>
            <div class="img3"><img src="/Images/2.png" alt="2"><p>A <b>Flood Watch</b> means you should prepare for 
                flooding because conditions are favorable for a specific hazardous weather event to occur.</p></div>
            <div class="img3"><img src="/Images/3.png" alt="3"><p>A <b> Flood Warning</b> means a hazardous weather 
                event with flooding is imminent or already happening.</p></div>
            <h1 class="sub_topic">What Do I Do During a Flood?</h1>
            <p>If a flood event is happening, there are steps you can take to stay safe. The first and most important 
                thing to remember is to steer clear of flood waters. This is true even if you are in a car.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 30px;">Remember: <b>Turn around, don't drown!</b> Flood waters can rise or gain intensity 
                in the blink of an eye. Stay away from flood water at all costs.</p>
            <p>Another important tip that will help you survive a flood is to <b>listen to evacuation orders</b> from 
                authorities. We also stress that you listen to evacuation orders the first time you hear them. 
                Waiting even just a few minutes can be the difference between life and death. 
                And staying behind can put you and others at risk if you need to be rescued from rising waters.</p>
            <p>One last useful flood safety tip to pay attention to during a flood is to <b>stay away from rooms</b> where 
                water covers electrical outlets. This is pretty self-explanatory; you don't want to be electrocuted 
                walking through your flooded home or business.</p>
            <h1 class="sub_topic">What Do I Do After a Flood?</h1>
            <p>Once the flood waters recede, you might think you're safe. However, there are still plenty of flooding 
                dangers that can threaten your health and property. There are also things you should in case a flood 
                damages your property.</p>
            <p>One of the most important safety precautions after a flood is <b>making sure your water is safe</b> to drink. 
                Groundwater may have been contaminated during the flood so don't assume you can just turn on the faucet 
                and the water is safe.  Local authorities will let you know if water is safe to drink or if you should 
                boil it before using.</p>
            <p>After a flood, <b>standing water</b> is also a danger. While it might look tame compared to a raging flood, 
                standing water left behind is a breeding ground for bacteria and can carry toxins or chemicals. 
                If you have to touch standing water for cleanup or any other reason, protect yourself with rubber gloves, 
                boots, and other protective gear.</p>
            <p>Floodwaters can also hide <b>sharp or dangerous objects</b>, so it's best to avoid going into the water if you can.</p>
            <p>One last flood safety tip to keep in mind for after waters recede is to <b>wait for the all clear</b> 
                from local officials to return to buildings or areas compromised by the flood. While your home or 
                office might look safe to you, there could be major structural or electrical dangers. 
                Always wait for the all clear.
